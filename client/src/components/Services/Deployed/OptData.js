                    Depending on the needs of your application, we can discuss different database options.
                    Different AMS storage instances have slower retrieval times, which will cost you less
                    to store information. This option is great for companies that would like to store archived
                    data. This option is not preferred for data that needs to be readily available such as the
                    posts on your social media account.
